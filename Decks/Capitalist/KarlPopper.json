One of the 20th century\u0027s most influential philosophers of science, Popper is known for his rejection of the classical inductivist views on the scientific method in favour of empirical falsification. In political discourse, he is known for his vigorous defence of liberal democracy and the principles of social criticism that he believed made a flourishing open society possible. His political philosophy embraced ideas from major democratic political ideologies, including socialism/social democracy, libertarianism/classical liberalism and conservatism, and attempted to reconcile them.","Health":5182,"Attack":6037,"political_current":"Capitalist","PathToPhoto":"/home/daniel/Documents/Programacion/Proyecto Battle Cards/Cold-War-master/Images/popper.jpeg","Effect":[{"Value":"if","Type":3,"Location":{}},{"Value":"OpenBracket","Type":5,"Location":{}},{"Value":"FriederichHayek","Type":4,"Location":{}},{"Value":"DotOperator","Type":9,"Location":{}},{"Value":"Health","Type":3,"Location":{}},{"Value":"BooleanGreather","Type":6,"Location":{}},{"Value":"600","Type":1,"Location":{}},{"Value":"ClosedBracket","Type":5,"Location":{}},{"Value":"OpenCurlyBraces","Type":5,"Location":{}},{"Value":"print","Type":3,"Location":{}},{"Value":"OpenBracket","Type":5,"Location":{}},{"Value":"Death To the Soviets","Type":2,"Location":{}},{"Value":"ClosedBracket","Type":5,"Location":{}},{"Value":"StatementSeparator","Type":5,"Location":{}},{"Value":"ClosedCurlyBraces","Type":5,"Location":{}}]}
